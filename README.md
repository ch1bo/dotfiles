# Home sweet home.nix

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these are mine. My dotfiles
are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my
life. My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless...
and so on.

This is the place for my shell (zsh), terminal emulator (urxvt), window manager
(xmonad), editor (emacs) configuration and many more workflow improvements &
shortcuts (git aliases, fzf, z).

I used to symlink configurations from the home directory into this repository to
keep them maintainable, but have now migrated to
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). This allows me to
easily update and rollback between generations of my whole user environment.

## Install

## Disclaimer

No guarantee that this repo will always work for you. I do use this as *my*
dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break something if I forget to make a
check for a dependency.
