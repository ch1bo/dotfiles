My new notebook. The old Dell XPS 13 was getting slow due to limited RAM and I also longed for a better keyboard on the go. So I went with a ThinkPad X13 with the Ryzen PRO 5850U, supposedly beeing cool, silent and long battery life.. while having 8 cores for compiling stuff :)

| Model | Lenove ThinkPad X13 G2 AMD |
| CPU   | Ryzen 5850 Pro, 8 cores    |
| RAM   | 32GB LPDDR4X-4266          |
| SSD   | 512GB M.2 PCIe             |

* Partitioning
The single 512GB SSD is partitioned similar to my other NixOS hosts:

#+begin_src
   1            2048         1050623   512.0 MiB   EF00  boot
   2         1050624       934283263   445.0 GiB   8300  root
   3       934283264      1000215182   31.4 GiB    8200  swap
#+end_src

A standard FAT32 EFI boot partition, swap and root partition, where the latter
is home to a ZFS pool:

#+begin_src
mkfs.vfat -F32 -n boot /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-WDC_PC_SN730_SDBQNTY-512G-1001_21514Q802807-part1

mkswap /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-WDC_PC_SN730_SDBQNTY-512G-1001_21514Q802807-part3

zpool create -o ashift=12 -O acltype=posixacl -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=none root /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-WDC_PC_SN730_SDBQNTY-512G-1001_21514Q802807-part2
#+end_src

Currently the ZFS pool is setup with these data sets:

#+begin_src
zfs create -o mountpoint=none root/local
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy root/local/nix
zfs create -o mountpoint=none root/safe
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy root/safe/root
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy root/safe/home
zfs create -o refreservation=512M -o mountpoint=none root/reserved
#+end_src

Where the =root/reserved= can be shrinked when space runs out (required for deletion on a COW file system) with

#+begin_src
zfs set refreservation=none root/reserved
#+end_src
